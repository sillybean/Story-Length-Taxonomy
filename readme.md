Story Length Taxonomy
==========

A WordPress plugin for online magazines that creates a custom taxonomy and automatically tags posts based on their length. The default terms are the SFWA short fiction categories:

Short Story: 0-7500
Novelette: 7501-17500
Novella: 17501-40000
Novel: 40001-*

You can delete these and add your own if you prefer. To add a new category, create the term as usual and enter the word count range into the term description field, e.g. 0-1000. (You can enter commas if you find that more readable; the plugin will strip them automatically.) For no upper limit, use a star: 40000-*.
